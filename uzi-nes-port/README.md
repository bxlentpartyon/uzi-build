This is a public repo of Doug Braun's UZI (Unix: Z80 Implementation) source
code. The author's site no longer serves the archive and it took some
digging to find, so it's uploaded here for conservation purposes.

Although no LICENSE file is attached, Braun has posted elsewhere that this
code is public domain. If you are Doug Braun and wish me to remove this
code, I will naturally comply (albeit with regret).

The author's original page is here: http://www.dougbraun.com/uzi.html

This is interesting because the Z80 had 64kB of RAM, no mmu and various
other restrictions. This means it's a good jumping-off point for new projects
aimed at highly constrained systems, whether it be embedded or micro
guests on VMs.

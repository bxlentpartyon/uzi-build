- Up next:
  + Fix drivers/kb.c to not keep printing when a key is held down
  + Implement a bool type to overlay usigned char to avoid stupid mistakes
    like I had with the kb_checked var, where I wrote it as a byte in asm,
    but an int in C (i.e. 2 bytes).
    * Probably should have more safety checks for C<->ASM types like this.

7/8/24 - Move read_keyboard out of NMI to make more room for data transfers.

- di()/ei() should _not_ disable VBlank NMI - this should be handled separately.
  Currently we're enabling interrupts during interrupts, which is stupid and could
  cause problems.  I don't think it _has_ yet, but this definitely needs to be fixed.
- wait_frame_ei should probably only enable the VBlank NMI and not regular interrupts?
- Currently in the middle of changing PPU data buffer over to using locking instead
  of disabling VBlank NMIs.
- I think that I should be able to allow NMIs during IRQ if all of this other stuff
  is fixed correctly.  I know I explicitly forbade that forever ago, but I understood
  a lot less then.

- Up next:
  + Fix drivers/kb.c to not keep printing when a key is held down
  + Implement a bool type to overlay usigned char to avoid stupid mistakes
    like I had with the kb_checked var, where I wrote it as a byte in asm,
    but an int in C (i.e. 2 bytes).
    * Probably should have more safety checks for C<->ASM types like this.

7/8/24 - Move read_keyboard out of NMI to make more room for data transfers.
